            <h3>Hi! I'm Margaret :)</h3>
            <p>
              I am a mission driven Frontend software engineer with a particular 
              passion for <strong>building tools that make it easier to get
              things done</strong>. I will always go to bat for the user, and I
              am constantly thinking about what can be done to improve their
              experience.
            </p>
            <p>
              With a background in Sociology and Cyborg Anthropology, I have a
              keen eye for opportunities that will improve <strong> human-computer
              interaction</strong>. Providing customer service early in my career
              got me where I am today: highly empathetic to users and the teams
              that serve them. 
            </p>
            <p>
              My first foray into coding was when I used `display:none` to hide an
              audio player on my MySpace page so that every visitor got blasted with
              Bossy by Kelis featuring Too $hort and then couldn't make it stop.

                      I got to cut my teeth in software development working on the internal tools at Simple.
                      This gave me a chance to work on the full stack - a colossal Ruby on Rails app with
                      every JavaScript framework you can think of (including one you probably didn’t think
                      of, because it was our custom framework - Butcher). I kept in close contact with my
                      friends from Customer Support to help guide my work, and utilized this tight feedback
                      loop to iterate quickly. We typically worked without product or design guidance, but had
                      to build out support in our internal apps for any new customer facing feature. 
                    </p>
                  </div>

                  <div class="hidden" id="int-eng-long-story">
                    <p>
                      It was a very proud day for me when I accepted a job offer to join the engineering team at
                      Simple. I joined the department as a Ruby on Rails developer for the Internal Engineering
                      team. Throughout this time, I stayed in close contact with all my pals on the engineering
                      side - and these relationships helped us stay in a short feedback loop. 
                    </p>

                    <p>
                      Working on internal tools was challenging and rewarding for the same reasons - your
                      customers are in the same room as you. When we shipped a slick new feature, we quickly saw
                      the impacts and heard the positive reviews from across the room. And when we screwed 
                      something up, it was our friends who hurt because of it. Ultimately, though, I think this
                      was my favorite part about working on internal tools. We learned what worked and what didn’t
                      quickly, and we could also iterate quickly. We didn’t have our own product manager, so it was
                      often just the three of us engineers making decisions about what to build next and how it
                      should work. There wasn’t a lot of overhead, and it was fun to experiment.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                      One of my favorite projects was redesigning and rebuilding the flow after customer contact
                      where an agent would categorize the topic and leave notes about the call or chat. It was this
                      data that I had used when I was an agent to make product requests and suggestions for our
                      customers. I knew this data was really powerful, and was what the support team could leverage
                      to help our customers be heard inside the company. I was happy to have a chance to update the
                      flow so that we could gather data in a more precise and detailed way.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                      I learned and grew a ton in this role. I was writing a lot of Javascript, in a lot of different
                      frameworks - Mootools, JQuery, Butcher (a Javascript framework built in house), vanilla JS,
                      Bootstrap for most of our styles, and Ruby on Rails to interact with our data. When the decision
                      was made to dissolve the Internal tools team and to support these products from the other existing
                      functional teams at the company, I made the decision to focus on Frontend development, but I would
                      miss the full stack life!

                      After joining Simple’s customer support team, I was quickly hitting the top end of our
                      production goals for the number of cases handled per day. More importantly, I loved the
                      challenge brought on by each call or chat, and I loved helping to find solutions for
                      every customer I interacted with. I was a regular contributor to our Product repo,
                      documenting feature ideas or updates based on my interactions with customers. I leveraged
                      my background in Sociology to analyze large sets of contact data to support these proposals.
                    </p>
                  </div>

                  <div class="hidden" id="cust-ops-long-story">
                    <p>
                      I discovered Simple a few months after I graduated college. I was eager to find a job in
                      tech and I was actively teaching myself to code on the side. I applied for a Simple bank
                      account as enthusiastically as I applied for a job with them. Everything about it felt really
                      promising - they had a great product that I needed (badly) to help me get a grip on my
                      finances, they had open roles in customer support (a job I was well qualified for and excited
                      about doing), and I knew they supported women who wanted to learn to code (as I’d seen they
                      hosted a Women Who Hack day).
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      To my complete delight, I got the job! And I loved it. I loved figuring out how to build
                      rapport with each customer I talked to - getting to know them a little bit, and also doing
                      everything in my power to resolve their issue. I initially found phone support to be nerve
                      wracking, but I later found it exhilarating - thinking on my toes and finding solutions to
                      whatever problems the customers threw my way.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      I was also an active participant in product discussions - documenting customer contact,
                      articulating clearly the problems they faced, and making suggestions for how we might
                      improve them. When we rolled out customer to customer transfers, we were developing a
                      roll out plan and ran into a roadblock when we realized people with early access might
                      want to transfer to people who didn’t have access yet. I suggested we start by rolling
                      out to a small group and then give feature access to anyone those users attempted to add
                      as contacts. And that’s how we rolled it out.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      One of the things I was most impressed with when I started my job at Simple was that the
                      support software we used was built in house. Belvedere. There were two engineers working
                      on the app, and we saw quick and routine updates as needed. It looked really nice (Bootstrap,
                      I later learned) and it was tailored to our specific needs. I never expected that the internal
                      apps would be as user friendly as our customer facing products. The best part was that the
                      engineers working on Belvedere sat 20 feet away, and so I started pestering them with requests.
                      The two of them started a “Code Club” after work to teach any interested employees, and after
                      a few weeks, I was the only one still showing up. This turned into an opportunity for me to
                      work with them on the clock, on the same requests I had been pestering them with! It was the
                      best! I was closely connected with the support team, and with the job myself, and I knew how
                      we could improve efficiency through updates to Belvedere. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      The first thing I added to Belvedere while I was still working as an agent was a button at the
                      very top of a customer profile that copied their user ID to your clipboard, an idea that came
                      from another agent, and an update that saved us all time and clicks on every call and for every
                      chat.

                      I led a five person team through Lewis & Clark’s first annual Venture Competition to
                      the final round. We designed, built, and tested a platform that encouraged students
                      to share resources on campus. We formalized ourselves as an LLC and registered a 
                      Trademark. In parallel with that work, our team was hired to build the campus digital 
                      wayfinding system. 
                    </p>
                  </div>

                  <div class="hidden" id="ceo-long-story">
                    <p>
                      What started as a group project in a Cyborg Anthropology class turned into a team effort
                      in Lewis & Clark’s first ever Venture Competition. I led the five person team as CEO (I
                      cringe at this now, but we had to walk the walk!) and we pitched and built a product
                      called Kokonect - a tool that would help connect students to valuable resources on campus.
                      This was a time in the tech world when the Share Economy was a major buzzword, and we
                      were exploring what that could look like on college campuses.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      We got funding through the competition, and were subsequently also hired by the school to
                      build their online wayfinding/campus mapping system. We had two sources of funding - we
                      were on top of the world. With the money, we hired contractors to build both projects -
                      a web app that allowed anyone with a Lewis & Clark email address to create an account,
                      post offers or requests, and view a feed of resources other students wanted to share or
                      were looking for. We also built an interactive campus map and an admin UI to update the
                      map and all points of data on it. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      Additionally, we formalized ourselves as an LLC, and filed a Trademark. Ultimately the
                      mapping project became a higher priority because we had real, paying clients (good call),
                      but unfortunately we ran Kokonect into the ground when we couldn’t support both projects.
                      Devastating! I learned an incredible amount in those 6 or so months, and was also teaching
                      myself to code on the side (with hopes I could maintain Kokonect myself) when I saw a Women
                      Who Hack event on Portland’s tech events calendar hosted by a company I hadn't previously
                      heard of: Simple.
