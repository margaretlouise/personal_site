            <h3>Hi! I'm Margaret :)</h3>
            <p>
              I am a mission driven Frontend software engineer with a particular 
              passion for <strong>building tools that make it easier to get
              things done</strong>. I will always go to bat for the user, and I
              am constantly thinking about what can be done to improve their
              experience.
            </p>
            <p>
              With a background in Sociology and Cyborg Anthropology, I have a
              keen eye for opportunities that can *enhance* <strong> human-computer
              interaction</strong>. Providing customer service early in my career
              got me where I am today: highly empathetic to users and the teams
              that serve them. 
            </p>
            <p>
              My first foray into coding was when I used `display:none` to hide an
              audio player on my MySpace page so that every visitor got blasted with
              Bossy by Kelis featuring Too $hort and then couldn't make it stop.

                    <p>
                      I joined Boundless as Senior Software Engineer, ready to work across the stack
                      (primarily Rails and Typescript) on a product that helps immigrants get through the 
                      visa application process faster and more confidently. My favorite project that I lead
                      was the Milestone Tracker. To get started, I worked with the designer to refine the
                      designs and find ways to cut scope without sacrificing customer value. From there I
                      documented the required response body we would need, and any other necessary endpoints
                      to update customer data. I created tickets that the team could work on in parallel and
                      that would allow us to ship value when it was ready, rather than needing to complete
                      everything before it could go live. We shipped a beautiful new feature on time and to
                      spec. I also lead a book club, focused on supporting frontend leaning engineers learn
                      sustainable development with Rails. I found myself leading projects more confidently,
                      and with more clarity on what my values are as a leader.
                    </p>
                  </div>

                  <div class="hidden" id="sswe-long-story">
                    <p>
                      When I was looking for a new opportunity after Simple closed down, my two priorities
                      were finding another mission driven company and a company that was small enough that I’d
                      have an opportunity to contribute in a big way. I joined Boundless excited to get to work
                      on a product that helps immigrants go through the process of applying for a visa in the
                      United States more confidently and affordably. This was another full stack role - similar
                      to the first engineering job I had, I worked in a Ruby on Rails application, this time
                      with Typescript on the frontend. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      The first work I completed at Boundless was on our internal tools - giving agents the
                      ability to rotate, crop, and zoom in on uploaded images and documents. I was happy to find
                      lots of small ways to leave the code in a better spot than I found it along the way. I
                      enjoyed the chance to meet different folks in the company, the application guides that
                      worked to review customer’s applications and learn more about their workflows and think
                      about ways to improve their tools. One page had a long list of different states a customer
                      application might be in, with a number of buttons associated with each one. These buttons
                      were used regularly, but there were only a few that were relevant at any given time. I added
                      that logic into the code so that agents would be displayed only the buttons that they might
                      need, making it faster and easier to action the account without accidentally clicking the
                      wrong thing.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      I really loved working on the Milestone Tracker, which was a feature we added to a customer’s
                      account after they shipped their K1 Fiance Visa application. This feature helped customers
                      be prepared for all of the many steps involved after an application is submitted and on the
                      way to get married with a K1. We built a sort of checklist for the customer, providing them
                      with estimates of when to expect certain next steps based on when they input that a previous
                      step was completed. I worked with the designer to refine the designs in ways I knew would
                      result in less complex code (and quicker to implement) without sacrificing customer value. 
                      Next I documented the API and response body we would need to show and update the relevant data.
                      I wrote out our tickets that would allow the team to work in parallel and we shipped right on
                      time. Part of what I loved about this project was we were adding a huge amount of value and a
                      huge resource for customers, and we knew it would also help us stay in contact with the
                      customer when it came time to apply for their marriage based green card. It felt like a true
                      win/win for us and the customer.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      The Boundless engineering team was fully remote, and I enjoyed the challenge of forming
                      relationships with my coworkers without in office time. I wanted to level up my Rails abilities,
                      and had chosen a book to read to get started. I invited some other teammates to join me and we
                      ended up with a group of strong backend folks as well as the frontend leaning. It was a great
                      group because we were all learning from each other. We met every other week and I led the group
                      in discussion and came prepared with notes to get the ball rolling. I found this was a great way
                      to connect in a casual but productive way, and it worked well all being remote, too.

                      My work continued on the customer onboarding experience - refining existing features
                      and experimenting with different ways to drive engagement. I later moved to a team
                      that was focused mostly on building out new features. We shipped Paper Checks and
                      Certificates of Deposit. I led the efforts to add Live Chat to our web app and built
                      out self service Card Reorders as part of a larger initiative to give customers more
                      Self Serve options. I started a reading group for Frontend and QA engineers to learn
                      Typescript. I also wrote up a proposal for customer education that was greenlit for
                      development. I helped organize quarterly community service volunteer outings for the
                      Engineering department and a pandemic themed hackathon in 2020. This part of my career
                      at Simple saw a lot of personal growth -- taking on lots of solo projects, proposing
                      new features, and contributing to service design discussions.

                      As a Frontend Engineer II the main change from being an Engineer I was that I spent
                      more time building out Frontend components on my own, versus on a team with someone
                      more senior than I, collaborating on the same feature. I continued working on the product
                      team focused on onboarding for some time. We scrapped a lot of the work that had been done
                      on my previous team, and built out a new Welcome experience for when new customers logged
                      in for the first time. We shifted to encouraging them to try out some of our features and
                      giving users a bigger overview of what they could do next. We also rebuilt part of the
                      application flow to send image uploads to a third party to automate reviewing of
                      documentation, versus having all images reviewed manually by our customer operations team.

                    <p>
                      A lot of the work I had been focused on was refining and updating existing features.
                      The image upload change had zero customer facing changes: I needed to build a second
                      version of the form that looked *nearly* identical, but behind the scenes was managing
                      the uploads completely differently. This was a huge win for our Cust Ops team (something
                      that always motivated me) and I liked working on refinements - it felt good to commit to
                      an area of customer experience and really dig deep, but I was soon on a new team that was
                      building out and launching brand new features! 
                    </p>
                    
                    <p>
                      This was fun too - the first thing we shipped for customers was Paper Checks. When we
                      were discussing what we wanted from the API, we talked about the need to stop check
                      payments. We’d have an internal endpoint that a Cust Ops agent could hit from
                      SalesForce with a check number to cancel the payment. I made the suggestion that we
                      build the stop payment feature right into our apps, so that customers could self serve,
                      and cancel a payment themselves. This was a carryover from my work on the Customer
                      Support team - always looking for ways we could eliminate the need for customers to
                      reach out to us to begin with. I really liked working with Backend engineers at this
                      stage of projects - talking about API design and thinking about the full product
                      experience for our users.

                    <p>
                      The next big feature we built was Certificates of Deposit (CDs). I had never heard of
                      a CD. We built an application flow within our banking app, a list view of the CDs and
                      a transaction list of interest deposits. It was sort of a funny experience because
                      although I had never heard of a CD at the beginning, it ended up being one of the most
                      straightforward product development experiences I had. It was a clearly defined financial
                      product, and we did our best to make the signup process as “Simple” as possible.
                      Unfortunately we launched at the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic, right as the Fed
                      dropped interest rates - and a product we hoped would attract customers with a high
                      interest rate no longer had a high interest rate.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                      After that work wrapped up, I had the chance to focus on an initiative I was really
                      passionate about: customer quality of life enhancements. We called them paper cuts -
                      anything that was causing customer confusion, overly burdensome flows, or otherwise
                      product annoyances. The biggest priority was building out more self service offerings:
                      customers should be able to order new cards online, without contacting Customer Support.
                      This was a project I led - working with Backend to define the client needs and
                      legal/compliance requirements, and working with other clients to provide entry points
                      to a webview flow. Another project I led during this time was our first Live Chat feature -
                      using the SalesForce embedded Live Chat, integrated into our web app.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                      My other goal was to build out a set of Customer Education tools - we knew we had a
                      great product, but it wasn’t always easy to get people to really USE it. We had budgeting
                      tools that had helped lots of our customers save thousands of dollars and pay off huge
                      debts - how could we connect more customers to that value? I wrote up a proposal for
                      Customer Education experiments, worked with design on some mock ups for different
                      approaches we could take and test out, and presented the proposal to the company. The
                      proposal was greenlit, and had the go ahead to be worked on. Not long after, when Simple
                      announced that we would be closing down, our focus reshifted again - this time to self
                      service account closures. 😢

                      I joined the Frontend Engineering team to focus on building out our customer facing
                      tools in React in addition to continuing to build and support our customer support
                      tools. I was the primary contributor on the work to support Shared Accounts in our
                      internal tools - requiring a huge reworking of the app, updating customer profiles
                      from an assumption that each customer would have only one account to the reality that
                      each customer could have several accounts. I was also part of a team that was also
                      heavily focused on our application and onboarding customer facing experience. I helped
                      build an initial funding flow, integrating with Plaid and running experiments that
                      increased users first deposits into their new accounts.

                      In an effort to get more resources to build out internal tools, the decision was made to
                      divide and conquer, and the Internal Engineering team dissolved. Some of us moved to the
                      Backend Engineering team, some to Frontend, and some to Data. I joined Frontend because
                      our other Backend systems at Simple were written in Java, not Ruby - so I felt I had a
                      better chance picking up speed on the Frontend team. I also found it very gratifying to
                      make things look nice, and Backend felt out of reach to me at the time.

                    <p>
                      At first I was still working exclusively on our internal tools, but from a different
                      domain team. Many of our services and apps were built on the assumption that 1 customer
                      = 1 account. Building out Shared Accounts was a huge undertaking for all of our engineers.
                      I was responsible for updating the customer support application to handle both accounts per
                      customer. I was in over my head, but I pulled it off! I was used to working closely with a
                      more senior developer who was no longer at the company, and it felt like a real sink or
                      swim moment for me. Succeeding on that project made me feel like a Real Engineer. Ha!
                    </p>

                    <p>
                      There was ongoing work to “retire” our homegrown support tool and move to SalesForce (this,
                      to me, was tragic). It had admittedly always been a struggle to support internal tools - we
                      were always under-resourced, and frequently forgotten until the last minute when it came to
                      new feature support. I understood this decision, but also wished that we could have dumped
                      the money that was going to go to Salesforce into rebuilding parts of our homegrown tool.
                      To this day (2021) many teams still depend heavily on that tool, while also running Salesforce
                      in parallel. Despite its shortcomings, it was and is a great product that just needed a little
                      extra love! 
                    </p>

                    <p>
                      This was around the same time that I started working on our customer facing products. My first
                      introduction to our customer facing products was also our customer’s first introduction to
                      Simple: I began working on our web bank account application flow and the first landing page
                      flow when a customer logged in for the first time. We built in our first Plaid integration
                      to drive initial funding by making it quicker and easier to link an account and initiate that
                      first transfer. We continued to run A/B tests on initial funding and were successfully raising
                      initial funding amounts. It was really fun to work on small refinements that were having an
                      impact.

                      I got to cut my teeth in software development working on the internal tools at Simple.
                      This gave me a chance to work on the full stack - a colossal Ruby on Rails app with every
                      JavaScript framework you can think of (including one you probably didn’t think of, because
                      it was our custom framework - Butcher). I kept in close contact with my friends from
                      Customer Support to help guide my work, and utilized this tight feedback loop to iterate
                      quickly. We typically worked without product or design guidance, but had to build out
                      support in our internal apps for any new customer facing feature. I also helped organize
                      an Engineering wide hack week that would focus on improvements requested by our customer
                      support agents: updates that would help them work more efficiently or could help cut back
                      on main contact drivers.

                      It was a very proud day for me when I accepted a job offer to join the engineering team at
                      Simple. I joined the department as a Ruby on Rails developer for the Internal Engineering
                      team. Throughout this time, I stayed in close contact with all my pals on the engineering
                      side - and these relationships helped us stay in a short feedback loop.

                    <p>
                      Working on internal tools was challenging and rewarding for the same reasons - your
                      customers are in the same room as you. When we shipped a slick new feature, we quickly saw
                      the impacts and heard the positive reviews from across the room. And when we screwed 
                      something up, it was our friends who hurt because of it. Ultimately, though, I think this
                      was my favorite part about working on internal tools. We learned what worked and what didn’t
                      quickly, and we could also iterate quickly. We didn’t have our own product manager, so it was
                      often just the three of us engineers making decisions about what to build next and how it
                      should work. There wasn’t a lot of overhead, and it was fun to experiment.

                    <p>
                      One of my favorite projects was redesigning and rebuilding the flow after customer contact
                      where an agent would categorize the topic and leave notes about the call or chat. It was this
                      data that I had used when I was an agent to make product requests and suggestions for our
                      customers. I knew this data was really powerful, and was what the support team could leverage
                      to help our customers be heard inside the company. I was happy to have a chance to update the
                      flow so that we could gather data in a more precise and detailed way.

                    <p>
                      I learned and grew a ton in this role. I was writing a lot of Javascript, in a lot of different
                      frameworks - Mootools, JQuery, Butcher (a Javascript framework built in house), vanilla JS,
                      Bootstrap for most of our styles, and Ruby on Rails to interact with our data. When the decision
                      was made to dissolve the Internal tools team and to support these products from the other existing
                      functional teams at the company, I made the decision to focus on Frontend development, but I would
                      miss the full stack life!

                      production goals for the number of cases handled per day. More importantly, I loved the
                      challenge brought on by each call or chat, and I loved helping to find solutions for
                      every customer I interacted with. I was a regular contributor to our Product repo,
                      documenting feature ideas or updates based on my interactions with customers. I leveraged
                      my background in Sociology to analyze large sets of contact data to support these proposals.

                    <p>
                      I discovered Simple a few months after I graduated college. I was eager to find a job in
                      tech and I was actively teaching myself to code on the side. I applied for a Simple bank
                      account as enthusiastically as I applied for a job with them. Everything about it felt really
                      promising - they had a great product that I needed (badly) to help me get a grip on my
                      finances, they had open roles in customer support (a job I was well qualified for and excited
                      about doing), and I knew they supported women who wanted to learn to code (as I’d seen they
                      hosted a Women Who Hack day).
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      To my complete delight, I got the job! And I loved it. I loved figuring out how to build
                      rapport with each customer I talked to - getting to know them a little bit, and also doing
                      everything in my power to resolve their issue. I initially found phone support to be nerve
                      wracking, but I later found it exhilarating - thinking on my toes and finding solutions to
                      whatever problems the customers threw my way.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      I was also an active participant in product discussions - documenting customer contact,
                      articulating clearly the problems they faced, and making suggestions for how we might
                      improve them. When we rolled out customer to customer transfers, we were developing a
                      roll out plan and ran into a roadblock when we realized people with early access might
                      want to transfer to people who didn’t have access yet. I suggested we start by rolling
                      out to a small group and then give feature access to anyone those users attempted to add
                      as contacts. And that’s how we rolled it out.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      One of the things I was most impressed with when I started my job at Simple was that the
                      support software we used was built in house. Belvedere. There were two engineers working
                      on the app, and we saw quick and routine updates as needed. It looked really nice (Bootstrap,
                      I later learned) and it was tailored to our specific needs. I never expected that the internal
                      apps would be as user friendly as our customer facing products. The best part was that the
                      engineers working on Belvedere sat 20 feet away, and so I started pestering them with requests.
                      The two of them started a “Code Club” after work to teach any interested employees, and after
                      a few weeks, I was the only one still showing up. This turned into an opportunity for me to
                      work with them on the clock, on the same requests I had been pestering them with! It was the
                      best! I was closely connected with the support team, and with the job myself, and I knew how
                      we could improve efficiency through updates to Belvedere. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      The first thing I added to Belvedere while I was still working as an agent was a button at the
                      very top of a customer profile that copied their user ID to your clipboard, an idea that came
                      from another agent, and an update that saved us all time and clicks on every call and for every
                      chat.

                      I led a five person team through Lewis & Clark’s first annual Venture Competition to
                      the final round. We designed, built, and tested a platform that encouraged students
                      to share resources on campus. We formalized ourselves as an LLC and registered a 
                      Trademark. In parallel with that work, our team was hired to build the campus digital 
                      wayfinding system. 
                    </p>
                  </div>

                  <div class="hidden" id="ceo-long-story">
                    <p>
                      What started as a group project in a Cyborg Anthropology class turned into a team effort
                      in Lewis & Clark’s first ever Venture Competition. I led the five person team as CEO (I
                      cringe at this now, but we had to walk the walk!) and we pitched and built a product
                      called Kokonect - a tool that would help connect students to valuable resources on campus.
                      This was a time in the tech world when the Share Economy was a major buzzword, and we
                      were exploring what that could look like on college campuses.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      We got funding through the competition, and were subsequently also hired by the school to
                      build their online wayfinding/campus mapping system. We had two sources of funding - we
                      were on top of the world. With the money, we hired contractors to build both projects -
                      a web app that allowed anyone with a Lewis & Clark email address to create an account,
                      post offers or requests, and view a feed of resources other students wanted to share or
                      were looking for. We also built an interactive campus map and an admin UI to update the
                      map and all points of data on it. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      Additionally, we formalized ourselves as an LLC, and filed a Trademark. Ultimately the
                      mapping project became a higher priority because we had real, paying clients (good call),
                      but unfortunately we ran Kokonect into the ground when we couldn’t support both projects.
                      Devastating! I learned an incredible amount in those 6 or so months, and was also teaching
                      myself to code on the side (with hopes I could maintain Kokonect myself) when I saw a Women
                      Who Hack event on Portland’s tech events calendar hosted by a company I hadn't previously
                      heard of: Simple.
